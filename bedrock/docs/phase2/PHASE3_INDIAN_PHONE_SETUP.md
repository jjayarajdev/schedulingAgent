## üí∞ Cost Comparison

| **AWS Connect DID** | 2 weeks wait | $110 | $0.044 | Lowest cost, longer setup |
| **Twilio + AWS** | 1-2 days | $146 | $0.058 | Fastest, 30% more expensive |
| **Exotel + AWS** | 3-5 days | $135 | $0.054 | Indian company, good support |

**Recommended Strategy:**
1. **Month 1-2:** Twilio (fast launch)
2. **Month 3+:** Native AWS DID (cost optimization)

---

## üìû Alternative Indian Telecom Providers

### Option: Exotel (Indian Company)

**Pros:**
‚úÖ Indian company, easier compliance
‚úÖ Better India-specific support
‚úÖ 3-5 day approval
‚úÖ Good for Indian market

**Cons:**
‚ùå More expensive than AWS native
‚ùå Extra integration layer

**Setup:** Similar to Twilio, use SIP forwarding to AWS Connect

**Pricing:** ~$0.012/min + AWS Connect fees

---

### Option: Knowlarity

**Pros:**
‚úÖ Enterprise-grade reliability
‚úÖ Strong in India market
‚úÖ Faster approval (3-5 days)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: Document Rejection

**Common Reasons:**
- Address proof >3 months old
- LOA not on letterhead
- Missing company stamp
- Unclear scans (photos instead of scans)

**Solution:**
- Use scanner, not phone camera
- Ensure all text is readable
- Get fresh utility bill if needed
- Have LOA notarized if possible

---

### Issue: Long Approval Time (>15 Days)

**Actions:**
1. Reply to AWS support case asking for status update
2. Check if carrier contacted you directly (check spam folder)
3. Escalate via AWS account manager if available
4. Use Twilio as interim solution

---

### Issue: Number Not Available in Desired City

**Solution:**
- Most flexible: Choose Mumbai (largest pool)
- Alternative: Delhi, Bangalore
- Toll-free: Available nationally but longer approval

---

---

## üìä Regional Coverage in India

### AWS Connect Regions

**Primary:** `ap-south-1` (Mumbai) ‚úÖ Recommended
- Lowest latency for Indian customers
- Full feature support
- Indian DID numbers available

**Backup:** `ap-southeast-1` (Singapore)
- Fallback for disaster recovery
- Higher latency (~50ms)
- Can claim Indian numbers but slower

---

### Indian Mobile Carriers Supported

AWS Connect works with **all major Indian carriers:**

‚úÖ Reliance Jio
‚úÖ Bharti Airtel

---

## üéì Best Practices

### 1. Start Early

### 2. Have Backup Plan
Always have Twilio as fallback in case of AWS DID delays.

### 3. Test Thoroughly
Test from multiple carriers (Jio, Airtel, Vi) before public launch.

### 4. Monitor Closely
