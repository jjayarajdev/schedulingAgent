  "agentStatus": "PREPARED",
  "agentCollaboration": "DISABLED",
  "foundationModel": "us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0",

```

---

## üîß Setup Steps

### Step 1: Verify Agent Status

```bash
aws bedrock-agent get-agent \
  --agent-id 2SUXQSWZOV \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --query 'agent.{Name:agentName,Status:agentStatus,Collab:agentCollaboration}' \
  --output table
```

**Expected Result:**
```
Status: PREPARED
Collab: DISABLED
```

---

### Step 2: Agent Instructions (No B2B Updates Needed)

**Note:** The Chitchat Agent handles casual conversation only and doesn't access customer data, projects, or business logic. Therefore, B2C/B2B awareness is not required for this agent.

**Current Instructions (No Changes):**
```
You are a friendly chitchat agent that handles casual conversation and customer service.

Your responsibilities:
1) Respond to greetings and goodbyes
2) Handle small talk and casual questions
3) Provide general company information
4) Be friendly and professional

For specific tasks like scheduling, information queries, or notes, tell customers that the specialist agents will help them.

Always be warm, helpful, and maintain a positive tone.
```

**Why no B2B updates?**
- Chitchat doesn't handle customer IDs, client IDs, or projects
- No data operations or business logic
- Pure conversational responses using LLM only
- Same behavior for B2C and B2B customers

---

### Step 3: No Action Groups Needed

**Important:** The Chitchat Agent does NOT have action groups or Lambda functions. It uses only the foundation model (Claude Sonnet 4.5) to generate conversational responses.

**Why no action groups?**
- Chitchat doesn't need to access external systems
- No database queries or API calls required
- Pure conversational AI using the LLM
- Faster response times (no Lambda cold starts)

  --follow \
  --region us-east-1

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Agent Cannot Be Prepared

**Error:** `This agent cannot be prepared. The AgentCollaboration attribute is set to SUPERVISOR_ROUTER`

**Solution:** Update agent collaboration to `DISABLED`:
```bash
aws bedrock-agent update-agent \
  --agent-id 2SUXQSWZOV \
  --agent-name scheduling-agent-chitchat \
  --foundation-model us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0 \
  --agent-resource-role-arn arn:aws:iam::618048437522:role/scheduling-agent-chitchat-agent-role-dev \
  --agent-collaboration DISABLED \
  --instruction "You are a friendly chitchat agent..." \
  --region us-east-1

aws bedrock-agent prepare-agent --agent-id 2SUXQSWZOV --region us-east-1
```

### Issue 2: Agent Tries to Handle Scheduling

**Symptom:** Chitchat agent attempts to schedule appointments directly

**Solution:** Update agent instructions to emphasize redirection:
```
For scheduling tasks, always tell customers that our Scheduling specialist will help them.
Never attempt to schedule, check availability, or confirm appointments yourself.
```

### Issue 3: Responses Too Long

**Symptom:** Chitchat agent gives overly detailed responses

**Solution:** Update instructions to be more concise:
```
Keep responses brief and friendly. For detailed information, redirect to specialist agents.
```

### Issue 4: Not Routing to Supervisor

**Symptom:** When accessed through supervisor, chitchat doesn't integrate well

**Solution:**
1. Verify supervisor has chitchat agent as collaborator
2. Check supervisor instructions mention chitchat for casual conversation
3. Test routing from supervisor agent

## üîê IAM Permissions

### Agent Role Permissions

The chitchat agent role (`scheduling-agent-chitchat-agent-role-dev`) needs minimal permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "bedrock:InvokeModel"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** No Lambda permissions needed since this agent has no action groups.

---

## üìù Configuration Files

### Agent Configuration
- **Location:** Managed by AWS Bedrock (no local file)
- **View:** AWS Console or CLI (`aws bedrock-agent get-agent`)

### No Lambda Code
- **Reason:** This agent uses only the LLM, no external actions
- **Benefit:** Faster responses, simpler architecture

### No OpenAPI Schema
- **Reason:** No action groups configured
- **Benefit:** Less complexity, easier maintenance

## üí° Design Philosophy

### Why Have a Separate Chitchat Agent?

**1. Separation of Concerns**
- Keeps conversational logic separate from business logic
- Specialist agents focus on their specific tasks
- Easier to tune each agent's behavior

**2. Better Customer Experience**
- Warm, friendly first interaction
- Smooth transitions to specialist agents
- Natural conversation flow

**3. Reduced Token Usage**
- Chitchat doesn't need context from Lambda functions
- Faster responses (no Lambda cold starts)
- Lower costs for casual conversation

**4. Easier Maintenance**
- Update chitchat personality without affecting business logic
- Test conversational improvements independently
- Simple to add new greetings or responses

---

## üìä Cost Optimization

### Chitchat Agent Costs

**Model Usage Only:**
- No Lambda invocations
- No API calls
- Just Claude Sonnet 4.5 model tokens

**Estimated Cost per Conversation:**
- Input tokens: ~100 (user greeting + context)
- Output tokens: ~50-100 (friendly response)
- Cost: ~$0.0015 - $0.003 per interaction

**Comparison:**
- Chitchat: $0.003 per interaction
- Scheduling with Lambda: $0.005 - $0.010 per interaction
- Information with Lambda: $0.005 - $0.010 per interaction

**Monthly Costs (1000 chitchat interactions):**
- Model: ~$3
- No Lambda costs
- Total: ~$3/month
