# Schema Updates Complete - B2C/B2B Support

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** ✅ All schemas updated to intelligently handle both B2C and B2B business models

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Problem
Agents were asking for `client_id` even when it's not needed or can be inferred from context. This created unnecessary back-and-forth in conversations.

### Solution
Updated all OpenAPI schemas to only request parameters that are truly needed:

**Key Principle:** *"Never ask for information you don't need or can infer from context"*

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Scheduling Actions (`scheduling-actions-schema.json`)

| Action | Before | After | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| `list-projects` | `customer_id` required, `client_id` optional | ✅ Same (client_id optional for B2B filtering) | Need customer to list. Client is optional filter. |
| `get-available-dates` | `project_id` required, `client_id` optional | ✅ **Removed `client_id`** | Project implies client context |
| `get-time-slots` | `project_id`, `date`, `request_id` required, `client_id` optional | ✅ **Removed `client_id`** | All context in project + request_id |
| `confirm-appointment` | `project_id`, `date`, `time`, `request_id` required, `client_id` optional | ✅ **Removed `client_id`** | Project has client context |
| `reschedule-appointment` | `project_id`, `new_date`, `new_time`, `request_id` required, `client_id` optional | ✅ **Removed `client_id`** | Project has client context |
| `cancel-appointment` | `project_id` required, `client_id` optional | ✅ **Removed `client_id`** | Project ID sufficient |

**Summary:** Removed `client_id` from 5 actions, kept it optional in `list-projects` for B2B filtering

---

### 2. Information Actions (`information-actions-schema.json`)

| Action | Before | After | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| `get-project-details` | `project_id`, `customer_id` required, `client_id` optional | ✅ **Removed `client_id`** | Project implies client |
| `get-appointment-status` | `project_id` required, `customer_id`, `client_id` optional | ✅ **Removed `customer_id` and `client_id`** | Project ID sufficient |
| `get-working-hours` | `client_id` required | ✅ **Made completely optional** | Returns default hours |
| `get-weather` | `location` required, `client_id` optional | ✅ **Removed `client_id`** | Weather is location-based |

**Summary:** Removed `client_id` from all 4 actions, made `get-working-hours` parameter-free

---

### 3. Notes Actions (`notes-actions-schema.json`)

| Action | Before | After | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| `add-note` | `project_id`, `note_text` required, `author`, `client_id` optional | ✅ **Removed `client_id`** | Notes belong to projects |
| `list-notes` | `project_id` required, `client_id` optional | ✅ **Removed `client_id`** | Project ID sufficient |

**Summary:** Removed `client_id` from both actions

---

## 📊 Business Model Support

### B2C (Direct Business)
```
Customer CUST001
  ├── PROJECT001 (Kitchen Remodel)
  ├── PROJECT002 (Bathroom Update)
  └── PROJECT003 (Deck Construction)
```

**How it works:**
- List projects: `customer_id=CUST001` → Returns all 3 projects
- Schedule PROJECT001: `project_id=PROJECT001` → No customer_id or client_id needed
- Get status: `project_id=PROJECT001` → Works directly

---

### B2B (Multi-Client Conglomerate)
```
Customer BIGCORP
  ├── Client Tampa (09PF05VD)
  │     ├── PROJECT001
  │     ├── PROJECT002
  │     └── PROJECT003
  ├── Client Miami (09PF05WE)
  │     ├── PROJECT004
  │     └── PROJECT005
  └── Client Orlando (09PF05XF)
        ├── PROJECT006
        └── PROJECT007
```

**How it works:**
- List all projects: `customer_id=BIGCORP` → Returns all 7 projects
- List Tampa only: `customer_id=BIGCORP`, `client_id=09PF05VD` → Returns 3 projects
- Schedule PROJECT004: `project_id=PROJECT004` → No customer_id or client_id needed (implied from project)

---

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: B2C Customer Flow
```
User: Show me all my projects for customer CUST001
Agent: [Calls list-projects with customer_id=CUST001]
→ Returns 3 projects

User: Schedule project PROJECT001
Agent: [Calls get-available-dates with project_id=PROJECT001]
→ Shows available dates (NO asking for customer_id or client_id)

User: Book October 20th at 10 AM
Agent: [Calls confirm-appointment with project_id, date, time, request_id]
→ Confirms appointment (NO asking for customer_id or client_id)
```

**✅ Expected:** Smooth flow, no redundant questions

---

### Scenario 2: B2B Customer Flow
```
User: Show me all projects for customer BIGCORP
Agent: [Calls list-projects with customer_id=BIGCORP]
→ Returns 50 projects across all locations

User: Show me only Tampa location projects
Agent: [Calls list-projects with customer_id=BIGCORP, client_id=09PF05VD]
→ Returns 10 Tampa projects only

User: Schedule project PROJECT004
Agent: [Calls get-available-dates with project_id=PROJECT004]
→ Shows available dates (NO asking for client_id - already knows from project)

User: What are your business hours?
Agent: [Calls get-working-hours with no parameters]
→ Returns default business hours

User: What are Tampa location hours?
Agent: [Calls get-working-hours with client_id=09PF05VD]
→ Returns Tampa-specific hours
```

**✅ Expected:** Intelligent handling of B2B multi-client scenario

## 🔧 Next Steps

### 1. Update Action Groups in AWS Console

You need to manually update the OpenAPI schemas for all 3 agents:

#### Scheduling Agent (IX24FSMTQH)
1. Go to: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/agents/IX24FSMTQH
2. Edit `scheduling_actions` action group
3. Copy schema from: `bedrock/lambda/schemas/scheduling-actions-schema.json`
4. Paste and validate
5. Save and **Prepare** agent

#### Information Agent (C9ANXRIO8Y)
1. Go to: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/agents/C9ANXRIO8Y
2. Edit `information_actions` action group
3. Copy schema from: `bedrock/lambda/schemas/information-actions-schema.json`
4. Paste and validate
5. Save and **Prepare** agent

#### Notes Agent (G5BVBYEPUM)
1. Go to: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/agents/G5BVBYEPUM
2. Edit `notes_actions` action group
3. Copy schema from: `bedrock/lambda/schemas/notes-actions-schema.json`
4. Paste and validate
5. Save and **Prepare** agent

---

### 2. Test All Scenarios

**B2C Tests:**
- `Show me projects for customer CUST001`
- `Schedule project PROJECT001`
- `What's the appointment status for PROJECT001?`
- `Add a note to PROJECT001: Customer prefers mornings`

**B2B Tests:**
- `Show me all projects for customer BIGCORP`
- `Show me only Tampa location projects` (should use client_id filter)
- `Schedule project PROJECT004`
- `What are your business hours?` (should work without asking)

## 📝 Documentation

All related documentation updated:
- ✅ `BUSINESS_MODEL_ANALYSIS.md` - Detailed analysis of B2C vs B2B
- ✅ `ACTION_GROUP_UPDATE_NEEDED.md` - Update instructions
- ✅ All 3 OpenAPI schemas updated
- ✅ Lambda handlers already support optional parameters

---

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **More Natural Conversations**
   - No redundant questions
   - Agents don't ask for information they already have

2. **Context-Aware**
   - Understands B2C vs B2B scenarios
   - Uses customer/client/project relationships intelligently

3. **Simpler User Experience**
   - Users only provide what's truly needed
   - Less back-and-forth

4. **Flexible for Both Models**
   - Direct customers: Simple, straightforward
   - Multi-client customers: Optional filtering available

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Lambda functions already updated** - No Lambda changes needed
- **Action groups must be manually updated** - AWS Console only (no CLI method works reliably)
- **Test thoroughly** - Verify both B2C and B2B scenarios
- **Prepare agents after update** - Critical step for changes to take effect

---

**Status:** ✅ Ready for action group updates and testing
**Next Action:** Update action groups in AWS Console (3 agents × 1 action group each = ~10 minutes)
