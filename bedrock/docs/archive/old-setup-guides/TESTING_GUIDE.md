## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Chitchat (Greeting)

**Test Messages:**
```
Hello!
Hi there!
How are you doing?
Good morning!
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Routes to: `chitchat_collaborator`
- Response: Warm greeting
- No action groups invoked
- Friendly, conversational tone

**Example Response:**
```
Hello! I'm doing great, thank you for asking! I'm here to help you
with scheduling appointments and any questions you might have.
How can I assist you today?
```

---

### Scenario 2: Scheduling Request

**Test Messages:**
```
I want to schedule an appointment
I need to book a meeting
Can I schedule something?
I'd like to make an appointment
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Routes to: `scheduling_collaborator`
- Response: Asks about project selection
- Would invoke: `list_projects` (when Lambda connected)
- Guides through 4-step scheduling workflow

**Example Response:**
```
I'd be happy to help you schedule an appointment! Let me show you
your available projects so you can choose which one you'd like to
schedule for.

[Note: Currently action groups are not connected, so actual project
list won't appear. This will work once Lambda functions are deployed
in Phase 2]
```

---

### Scenario 3: Information Query

**Test Messages:**
```
What are your working hours?
When are you open?
What time do you close?
Tell me about business hours
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Routes to: `information_collaborator`
- Response: Provides information
- Would invoke: `get_working_hours` (when Lambda connected)

**Example Response:**
```
Let me get that information for you!

[Note: Currently action groups are not connected. Once Lambda
functions are deployed, this will return actual working hours
from the PF360 system]
```

---

### Scenario 4: Notes Request

**Test Messages:**
```
Add a note that I prefer morning appointments
Can you add a note?
I want to leave a note
Please note that I need parking
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Routes to: `notes_collaborator`
- Response: Confirms note addition
- Would invoke: `add_note` (when Lambda connected)

**Example Response:**
```
I'd be happy to add a note for you!

[Note: Currently action groups are not connected. Once Lambda
functions are deployed, this will save the note to your profile
in the PF360 system]
```

---

### Scenario 5: Multi-Turn Conversation

**Test this in Console or Interactive mode:**

```
User: Hello!
Agent: [Greeting from chitchat_collaborator]

User: I want to schedule an appointment
Agent: [Routes to scheduling_collaborator, asks for project]

User: What are your hours?
Agent: [Routes to information_collaborator, provides hours]

User: Thanks!
Agent: [Routes to chitchat_collaborator, says you're welcome]
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Supervisor correctly routes each message
- Context is maintained across turns
- Smooth transitions between collaborators

---

## üéØ What to Look For

### Successful Routing

When testing in AWS Console, you should see:

1. **User Input** - Your message
2. **Agent Thinking** - "Analyzing request..."
3. **Routing Decision** - Which collaborator was selected
4. **Collaborator Response** - The actual response

**Example Console Output:**
```
User: Hello!

Agent Thinking...
Routing to: chitchat_collaborator

chitchat_collaborator: Hello! I'm doing great, thank you for asking!
How can I assist you today?
```

### Incorrect Routing

If routing is wrong:
- Scheduling message goes to chitchat ‚ùå
- Information query goes to notes ‚ùå
- Generic greeting goes to scheduling ‚ùå

**This usually means:**
- Agent instructions need tuning
- Collaborator descriptions unclear
- Re-prepare agent needed

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: API Permission Denied

**Error:**
```
Access denied when calling Bedrock. Check your request permissions
```

**Solution:**
- Use AWS Console testing (Method 1)
- Or use the new interactive script (Method 2) which provides console instructions
- API permissions may need additional setup

---

### Issue 2: Agent Not Responding

**Symptoms:**
- No response in console
- Error messages
- Blank output

**Checks:**
```bash
# Check agent status
aws bedrock-agent get-agent --agent-id 5VTIWONUMO --region us-east-1 | grep agentStatus

# Should show: "agentStatus": "PREPARED"
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Re-prepare agent
aws bedrock-agent prepare-agent --agent-id 5VTIWONUMO --region us-east-1

# Wait 20 seconds
sleep 20

# Test again
```

---

### Issue 3: Wrong Collaborator Selected

**Symptoms:**
- Greeting goes to scheduling agent
- Scheduling request goes to chitchat
- Routing seems random

**Possible Causes:**
1. Agent instructions not clear enough
2. Collaborator descriptions overlap
3. Agent not prepared after changes

**Solution:**
1. Review agent instructions in `infrastructure/agent_instructions/supervisor.txt`
2. Ensure routing guidelines are clear
3. Re-prepare agent after any changes

---

### Issue 4: Action Groups Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Agent says "I'll check that" but no data returned
- Placeholder responses
- "Action groups not connected" messages

**This is EXPECTED for Phase 1:**
- Lambda functions not deployed yet (Phase 2)
- Action groups defined but not connected
- Agents can route correctly but can't execute actions yet

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 2: Build Lambda functions
- Connect Lambda to action groups
- Test end-to-end workflows

---

## üöÄ Advanced Testing

### Load Testing (Future)

Once Lambda functions are deployed:

```python
# Example load test script
import concurrent.futures
import boto3

def invoke_agent_concurrent(message):
    # Invoke agent logic
    pass

messages = ["Hello!"] * 100
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
    results = executor.map(invoke_agent_concurrent, messages)
```

### Integration Testing (Future)

Test full workflows:
1. Schedule appointment
2. Confirm booking
3. Add note
4. Check status
5. Reschedule
6. Cancel
