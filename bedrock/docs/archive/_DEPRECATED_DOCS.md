## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated Documents (Can Be Deleted)

### GETTING_STARTED.md
**Status:** OUTDATED
**Reason:** Talks about Phase 1 as infrastructure provisioning (Aurora, Redis, etc.), not Bedrock Agents

- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (for actual deployment)
**Created:** October 12, 2025
**Lines:** 453

**Why It's Outdated:**
- References building FastAPI backend and React frontend
