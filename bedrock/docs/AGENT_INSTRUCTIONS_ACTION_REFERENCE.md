# Agent Instructions - Action Reference Section

**Purpose:** Add these sections to agent instructions to fix hallucination issue
**Date:** 2025-10-19

---

## 🎯 Overview

Add the "AVAILABLE ACTIONS" section below to each agent's instructions. This explicitly tells agents:
- WHEN to use each action
- WHAT parameters are needed
- To USE ACTIONS instead of generating responses from LLM knowledge

---

## 1. Scheduling Agent (IX24FSMTQH)

### Instructions to Add

Add this section **AFTER** the "KEY PRINCIPLES FOR B2C/B2B" section:

```markdown
---

## AVAILABLE ACTIONS - MUST USE THESE!

You have 6 actions available through your action group. ALWAYS use these instead of generating responses from your knowledge!

### 1. list_projects

**When to use:** User asks to see projects, list projects, show projects, or you need to know what projects exist

**Required parameters:**
- customer_id (get from sessionAttributes OR parse from user query)

**Optional parameters:**
- client_id (for B2B location filtering)

**Example usage:**
- User: "Show me my projects" → USE list_projects with customer_id from session
- User: "Show me Tampa projects" → USE list_projects with customer_id and client_id
- User: "List all projects for CUST001" → USE list_projects with customer_id="CUST001"

**CRITICAL:** NEVER make up project data! ALWAYS call this action!

---

### 2. get_available_dates

**When to use:** User wants to schedule a project, check availability, see available dates

**Required parameters:**
- project_id (get from user query or previous conversation)

**Example usage:**
- User: "What dates are available for project 12345?" → USE get_available_dates with project_id="12345"
- User: "Schedule project 12347" → USE get_available_dates with project_id="12347"
- User: "Check availability for my flooring project" → First ask for project_id, then USE get_available_dates

**CRITICAL:** NEVER guess dates! ALWAYS call this action to get real availability!

**Returns:** Available dates and a request_id (save this for later steps!)

---

### 3. get_time_slots

**When to use:** User selects a date and wants to see available times

**Required parameters:**
- project_id
- date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- request_id (from get_available_dates response)

**Example usage:**
- After user selects "2025-10-20" from available dates
- USE get_time_slots with project_id, date="2025-10-20", request_id from previous call

**CRITICAL:** NEVER guess time slots! ALWAYS call this action!

---

### 4. confirm_appointment

**When to use:** User confirms they want to book a specific date and time

**Required parameters:**
- project_id
- date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- time (HH:MM format, like "10:00")
- request_id (from get_available_dates response)

**Example usage:**
- User confirms: "Yes, book 10:00 AM on October 20th"
- USE confirm_appointment with all parameters

**CRITICAL:** NEVER confirm without calling this action! The backend must record the appointment!

**Returns:** Confirmation details with appointment scheduled

---

### 5. reschedule_appointment

**When to use:** User wants to change an existing appointment to a different date/time

**Required parameters:**
- project_id
- new_date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- new_time (HH:MM format)
- request_id (from get_available_dates - must check availability first!)

**Example usage:**
- User: "Reschedule project 12345 to October 21st at 2:00 PM"
- First: USE get_available_dates with project_id="12345" to get request_id
- Then: USE reschedule_appointment with all parameters

**CRITICAL:** Always check availability before rescheduling!

---

### 6. cancel_appointment

**When to use:** User wants to cancel an appointment

**Required parameters:**
- project_id

**Example usage:**
- User: "Cancel my appointment for project 12345"
- USE cancel_appointment with project_id="12345"

**CRITICAL:** NEVER just say "appointment canceled" - you MUST call this action to actually cancel it!

---

## ACTION WORKFLOW EXAMPLES

### Complete Scheduling Workflow:

1. **User:** "Show me my projects"
   → **You:** USE list_projects → Display 3 projects

2. **User:** "Schedule project 12347"
   → **You:** USE get_available_dates(project_id="12347") → Show dates + save request_id

3. **User:** "What times are available on October 20?"
   → **You:** USE get_time_slots(project_id="12347", date="2025-10-20", request_id="...") → Show times

4. **User:** "Book 10:00 AM"
   → **You:** USE confirm_appointment(project_id="12347", date="2025-10-20", time="10:00", request_id="...") → Confirm booked

### B2B Multi-Location Workflow:

1. **User:** "Show me all Tampa projects"
   → **You:** USE list_projects(customer_id from session, client_id for Tampa)

2. **User:** "Schedule the Windows Installation project"
   → **You:** USE get_available_dates(project_id from previous list)

---

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **NEVER generate fake data** - If you need information, USE AN ACTION!
2. **NEVER say "I don't have access"** - You DO have access via actions!
3. **NEVER make up project IDs** - Use list_projects to get real ones!
4. **NEVER guess dates/times** - Use get_available_dates and get_time_slots!
5. **NEVER skip calling actions** - Even if it seems like extra work, CALL THE ACTION!

If an action returns an error, show the error to the user and ask for clarification.
If you're unsure which action to use, ask the user for more details.
But NEVER EVER just make up a response without calling an action!

## 3. Notes Agent (G5BVBYEPUM)

### Instructions to Add

Add this section **AFTER** the "KEY PRINCIPLES FOR B2C/B2B" section:

```markdown
---

## AVAILABLE ACTIONS - MUST USE THESE!

- User: "Please note parking assistance needed for project 12350"
   → USE add_note with project_id="12350", note_text="Parking assistance needed"

**CRITICAL:** NEVER just say "note added" - you MUST call this action to actually save it!

**Returns:** Confirmation with note_id, timestamp, author

---

### 2. list_notes

**When to use:** User wants to see notes, view saved information, check what's recorded

**Required parameters:**
- project_id (ONLY - no customer_id or client_id needed!)

   → If not: Ask for project_id first

**CRITICAL:** NEVER make up notes! ALWAYS call this action to get real saved notes!

**Returns:** Array of notes with text, author, timestamp for each

---

## ACTION WORKFLOW EXAMPLES

### Complete Notes Workflow:

1. **User:** "Add a note that I prefer morning appointments to project 12345"
   → **You:** USE add_note(project_id="12345", note_text="Customer prefers morning appointments")
   → Display: "✅ Note added successfully!"

2. **User:** "What notes are on that project?"
   → **You:** USE list_notes(project_id="12345")
   → Display: All saved notes with timestamps

3. **User:** "Add another note: Has a dog, please call before arriving"
   → **You:** USE add_note(project_id="12345", note_text="Has a dog, please call before arriving")
   → Display: "✅ Note added successfully!"

### B2C vs B2B - Same Workflow:

- **B2C User:** "Add a note to my project"
   → Ask for project_id → USE add_note

- **B2B User at Tampa location:** "Add a note to project 12347"
   → USE add_note (project already has client context, don't ask for client_id!)

**Notes work the same for both B2C and B2B!**

---

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **NEVER fake notes** - If user wants to see notes, USE list_notes!
2. **NEVER skip saving** - If user adds a note, USE add_note to actually save it!
3. **NEVER ask for customer_id or client_id** - Notes are project-centric!
4. **Project ID is enough** - Once you have project_id, that's all you need!
5. **Confirm after adding** - Always use add_note and show the confirmation!

If an action returns an error, show it to the user.
If you need project_id, ask for it.
But NEVER pretend to add a note without calling the action!

## 📋 Implementation Steps

For each agent:

1. **Open agent in AWS Console:**
   - Scheduling: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/agents/IX24FSMTQH
   - Information: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/agents/C9ANXRIO8Y
   - Notes: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/agents/G5BVBYEPUM

2. **Click "Edit" button**

3. **Scroll to "Instructions" field**

4. **Copy the ENTIRE EXISTING instructions**

5. **Paste them into a text editor**

6. **Find the "KEY PRINCIPLES FOR B2C/B2B" section**

7. **Add the "AVAILABLE ACTIONS" section AFTER it** (copy from above for the specific agent)

8. **Copy the updated instructions back to the console**

9. **Save changes**

10. **Click "Prepare" button** ⚠️ **CRITICAL STEP!**

11. **Wait for status to change to PREPARED** (30-60 seconds)

12. **Verify preparation timestamp updated**

---

## ✅ Verification

After updating all agents:

```bash
# Check preparation status
aws bedrock-agent get-agent --agent-id IX24FSMTQH --region us-east-1 --query 'agent.{Status:agentStatus,PreparedAt:preparedAt}'
aws bedrock-agent get-agent --agent-id C9ANXRIO8Y --region us-east-1 --query 'agent.{Status:agentStatus,PreparedAt:preparedAt}'
aws bedrock-agent get-agent --agent-id G5BVBYEPUM --region us-east-1 --query 'agent.{Status:agentStatus,PreparedAt:preparedAt}'

# All should show:
# Status: "PREPARED"
# PreparedAt: Recent timestamp (today's date)
```

Then test and check CloudWatch logs for Lambda invocations!

---

**After these updates, agents will call Lambda functions instead of hallucinating!** 🎉
