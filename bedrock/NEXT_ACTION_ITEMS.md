Run the actual tests to validate 100% accuracy claim:

```bash
# Navigate to bedrock directory
cd /Users/jjayaraj/workspaces/studios/projectsforce/schedulingAgent-bb/bedrock

# Test v2.0 edge case fixes (6 queries)
python3 tests/v2/test_improved_classification.py

# Full regression test (27 queries)
python3 tests/v2/test_results_table.py

# Frontend routing validation
python3 frontend/backend/test_frontend_routing.py
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ test_improved_classification.py: 6/6 correct (100%)
- ✅ test_results_table.py: 23/23 correct (100%)
- ✅ test_frontend_routing.py: 10/10 correct (100%)

**Time Estimate:** 30 minutes

### 2. **Start the Backend Server and Test Live**

```bash
# Start the Flask backend
cd frontend/backend
python3 app.py

# Server will start on http://localhost:5001
```

**Then test these queries:**

```bash
# In another terminal, test the API
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/chat/simple \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Show me my projects"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/chat/simple \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "I am feeling stressed, need to talk"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/chat/simple \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Add coffee to my shopping list"}'

# Check metrics endpoint
curl http://localhost:5001/api/metrics
```

**Expected Results:**
