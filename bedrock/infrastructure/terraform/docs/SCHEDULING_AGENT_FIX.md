# Scheduling Agent Session Attributes Fix

**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

---

## Problem Summary

The Scheduling Agent was asking users for `customer_id` and `client_id` even though these values were already provided in `sessionState.sessionAttributes`. This caused:

- ‚ùå Lambda actions never invoked
- ‚ùå Complete workflow failure
- ‚ùå Poor user experience (repetitive questions)

## Root Cause

The issue was **NOT** in the agent instructions, but in the **OpenAPI schema**.

### The Schema Problem

In `/infrastructure/openapi_schemas/scheduling_actions.json`, all operations marked `customer_id` and `client_id` as **required** parameters:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "customer_id": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Unique identifier for the customer"
    },
    "client_id": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Client identifier"
    }
  },
  "required": ["customer_id", "client_id"]  ‚Üê THIS WAS THE PROBLEM
}
```

When parameters are in the `required` array, the agent interprets them as user inputs that MUST be collected before invoking the action.

## The Solution

### Schema Changes

Removed `customer_id` and `client_id` from all `required` arrays and updated descriptions:

**Before**:
```json
{
  "customer_id": {
    "type": "string",
    "description": "Unique identifier for the customer"
  },
  "required": ["customer_id", "client_id"]
}
```

**After**:
```json
{
  "customer_id": {
    "type": "string",
    "description": "Unique identifier for the customer (automatically provided from session attributes)"
  },
  "required": []  ‚Üê customer_id and client_id removed
}
```

### Operations Updated

1. **list_projects**: Removed both from required array
2. **get_available_dates**: Removed customer_id from required
3. **get_time_slots**: Removed customer_id from required
4. **confirm_appointment**: Removed customer_id from required
5. **reschedule_appointment**: Removed customer_id from required
6. **cancel_appointment**: Removed customer_id from required

## Implementation Steps

```bash
# 1. Edit the local schema
vim /infrastructure/openapi_schemas/scheduling_actions.json

# 2. Upload to S3
aws s3 cp /infrastructure/openapi_schemas/scheduling_actions.json \
  s3://pf-schemas-dev-618048437522/scheduling_actions.json

# 3. Prepare the agent
aws bedrock-agent prepare-agent --agent-id "TIGRBGSXCS" --region us-east-1

# 4. Wait ~15 seconds for preparation

# 5. Test
python3 test_scheduling_session_fix.py
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix ‚ùå

```
Agent Response: "I'd be happy to show you your available projects!
To retrieve your project list, I need a couple of pieces of information:
1. **Customer ID** - Your unique customer identifier
2. **Client ID** - Your client identifier"

Lambda Invoked: NO
Status: FAIL
```

### After Fix ‚úÖ

```
Agent Response: "Here are your available projects:

**1. Flooring Installation**
   - Order: ORD-2025-001
   - Address: 123 Main St, Tampa, FL 33601

**2. Windows Installation**
   - Order: ORD-2025-002
   - Address: 456 Oak Ave, Tampa, FL 33602

**3. Deck Repair**
   - Order: ORD-2025-003
   - Address: 789 Pine Dr, Clearwater, FL 33755"

Lambda Invoked: YES ‚úÖ
Action: list_projects
Parameters: customer_id and client_id automatically included
Status: SUCCESS
```

## Key Learnings

### 1. Schema vs Instructions

**Agent Instructions** tell the agent HOW to behave and what to say.
**OpenAPI Schema** defines WHAT parameters are required from the user.

If a parameter is in the schema's `required` array, the agent will try to get it from the user, regardless of what the instructions say.

### 2. Session Attributes Behavior

Bedrock agents **automatically** include session attributes when invoking Lambda actions, BUT only if:
- The parameters exist in the schema (they don't need to be in required array)
- The parameter names match session attribute keys

### 3. Making Parameters Optional for Session Data

To use session attributes for certain parameters:
1. Define them in the schema properties (for documentation)
2. **Remove them from the `required` array**
3. Update descriptions to indicate they're auto-provided
4. The Lambda function should handle them whether provided by user or session

## Comparison: Information Agent

The Information Agent worked because its schema **never marked customer_id as required**:

```json
{
  "get_project_details": {
    "properties": {
      "project_id": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "required": ["project_id"]  ‚Üê Only project_id required, not customer_id
  }
}
```

## Updated Architecture

### Request Flow (After Fix)

```
User: "Show me my projects"
   ‚Üì
Scheduling Agent receives:
  - inputText: "Show me my projects"
  - sessionAttributes: { customer_id: "1645975", client_id: "09PF05VD" }
   ‚Üì
Agent reads schema:
  - customer_id: NOT in required array ‚Üí check session attributes
  - client_id: NOT in required array ‚Üí check session attributes
   ‚Üì
Agent invokes Lambda with:
  {
    "customer_id": "1645975",  ‚Üê from session
    "client_id": "09PF05VD"    ‚Üê from session
  }
   ‚Üì
Lambda returns projects
   ‚Üì
Agent formats response for user ‚úÖ
```

## Files Changed

1. **Schema**: `/infrastructure/openapi_schemas/scheduling_actions.json`
   - Removed customer_id and client_id from all required arrays
   - Updated descriptions

2. **S3**: `s3://pf-schemas-dev-618048437522/scheduling_actions.json`
   - Uploaded updated schema

3. **Agent**: TIGRBGSXCS (pf-scheduling)
   - Prepared with new schema

## Next Steps

- ‚úÖ Scheduling Agent now functional
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still need to verify end-to-end workflow with all 6 operations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Information Agent Lambda errors need investigation (separate issue)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Supervisor routing doesn't work (platform limitation, use frontend routing)
