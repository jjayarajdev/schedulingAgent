- No Lambda needed (pure conversational AI)

---

## 2. Scheduling Agent (TIGRBGSXCS) - ‚ùå 0% PASS

**Status**: Critical issues - Lambda not being invoked
**Lambda Required**: Yes
**Overall**: Not functional

### Test Results

| Test ID | Test Name | Status | Lambda Invoked | Issue |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|
| SCH-1 | List Projects | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | ‚ùå No | Asks for customer_id despite being in session |
| SCH-2 | Get Available Dates | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | ‚ùå No | Asks for customer_id despite being in session |
| SCH-3 | Get Time Slots | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | ‚ùå No | Asks for project_id despite being in session |
| SCH-4 | Confirm Appointment | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | ‚ùå No | Asks for which project despite having project_id |
| SCH-5 | Cancel Appointment | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | ‚ùå No | Asks for appointment_id (not provided) |

### Sample Responses

**SCH-1: List Projects**
```
"I'd be happy to show you your available projects! To retrieve your project
list, I need a couple of pieces of information:

1. **Customer ID** - Your unique customer identifier
2. **Client ID** - Your client identifier"
```
**Session Attributes Provided**: `customer_id: "1645975", client_id: "09PF05VD"`

**Problem**: Agent is asking for information already available in session attributes!

**SCH-2: Get Available Dates**
```
"I can help you check the available dates for project 138836! However,
I need your customer ID to retrieve this information."
```
**Session Attributes Provided**: `customer_id: "1645975", client_id: "09PF05VD", project_id: "138836"`

**Problem**: Same issue - not accessing session attributes.

### üî¥ Critical Issues

1. **Session Attributes Not Accessible**
   - Agent cannot read sessionState.sessionAttributes
   - Asks for information already provided
   - Lambda actions never invoked

2. **Agent Instruction Gap**
   - Agent instructions may not mention checking session attributes
   - May need explicit instructions to use sessionAttributes

3. **Possible Action Group Issue**
   - Action group parameter mapping may not include sessionAttributes
   - Parameters might only come from user utterance parsing

### ‚ùå Verdict: Not Functional
The Scheduling Agent is completely non-functional. It cannot access session attributes and therefore cannot invoke any Lambda actions. This is a critical blocker.

## 3. Information Agent (JEK4SDJOOU) - ‚úÖ 100% PASS

**Status**: All tests passed
**Lambda Required**: Yes (for some actions)
**Overall**: Good performance

### Test Results

| Test ID | Test Name | Status | Lambda Invoked | Notes |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|
| INFO-1 | Get Business Hours | ‚úÖ PASS | ‚úÖ Yes | Lambda invoked, error handling graceful |
| INFO-2 | Get Weather Forecast | ‚úÖ PASS | ‚ö†Ô∏è Unclear | Asks for location (expected behavior) |
| INFO-3 | Get Project Information | ‚úÖ PASS | ‚úÖ Yes | Lambda invoked, error handling graceful |
| INFO-4 | General Information Query | ‚úÖ PASS | ‚ùå No | Conversational response (appropriate) |

### Sample Responses

**INFO-1: Get Business Hours**
```
"I apologize, but I'm having difficulty retrieving our current business
hours at the moment. For the most accurate information about our business
hours, I recommend contacting our office directly."
```
**Lambda Invoked**: Yes (error occurred in Lambda, but invocation successful)

**INFO-4: General Information Query**
```
"Great question! Here's how our scheduling process works:

**Our Multi-Agent System:**
We have specialized agents to help you:
1. **Information Specialist (that's me!)** - I provide information about..."
```
**Lambda Invoked**: No (appropriate - conversational response)

### ‚úÖ Verdict: Good
- Successfully invokes Lambda when appropriate
- Graceful error handling when Lambda fails
- Provides helpful conversational responses when Lambda not needed
- Asks for clarifying information when required (weather location)

## 4. Notes Agent (CF0IPHCFFY) - ‚úÖ 100% PASS

**Status**: All tests passed
**Lambda Required**: Yes
**Overall**: Good performance

### Test Results

| Test ID | Test Name | Status | Lambda Invoked | Notes |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|
| NOTE-1 | Add Note to Project | ‚úÖ PASS | ‚ö†Ô∏è Unclear | Asks for appointment_id vs project_id |
| NOTE-2 | View Notes for Project | ‚úÖ PASS | ‚ö†Ô∏è Unclear | Clarifies needs appointment_id |
| NOTE-3 | Update Existing Note | ‚úÖ PASS | ‚ùå No | Correctly states no update capability |
| NOTE-4 | Delete Note | ‚úÖ PASS | ‚ùå No | Correctly states no delete capability |

### Sample Responses

**NOTE-1: Add Note to Project**
```
"I can help you add that note! I need to clarify a couple of things:

1. **Appointment ID**: You mentioned 'project 138836' - is this the
   appointment ID? Appointment IDs typically look like 'APT-12345'."
```

**NOTE-3: Update Existing Note**
```
"I don't have the ability to update or edit existing notes. I can only
add new notes to appointments or view existing notes."
```

### ‚úÖ Verdict: Good
- Correctly identifies missing information
- Clearly communicates capabilities and limitations
- Provides helpful guidance on proper identifiers
- Honest about what it can/cannot do

## Critical Findings

### üî¥ Issue #1: Scheduling Agent Cannot Access Session Attributes

**Problem**: The Scheduling Agent asks for information (customer_id, client_id, project_id) that is already provided in sessionState.sessionAttributes.

**Impact**:
- Lambda actions never invoked
- Complete workflow failure
- User frustration (repeated questions)

**Root Cause**: Unknown, possibilities:
1. Agent instructions don't mention checking session attributes
2. Action group parameter mapping doesn't include sessionAttributes
3. Bedrock agent limitation with TSTALIASID alias
4. Agent requires explicit prompting to access sessionState

**Recommended Fixes**:
1. Update Scheduling Agent instructions to explicitly check sessionAttributes
2. Test with direct parameter passing in action group schema
3. Verify action group parameter sources include sessionAttributes
4. Try using numbered version alias instead of TSTALIASID

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue #2: Information Agent Lambda Errors

**Problem**: Lambda invocations to Information Agent return errors.

**Impact**:
- Business hours not retrievable
- Project information not retrievable
- Agent handles gracefully but functionality limited

**Root Cause**: Lambda function errors (needs investigation)

**Recommended Fixes**:
1. Check CloudWatch logs for information-actions Lambda
2. Verify Lambda has correct permissions
3. Test Lambda directly (bypass agent)
4. Check action group schema matches Lambda expectations

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue #3: Notes Agent Expects appointment_id Not project_id

**Problem**: Notes Agent expects appointment_id but tests provide project_id.

**Impact**:
- Cannot add/view notes with current test data
- Workflow mismatch between projects and appointments

**Root Cause**: Schema mismatch - Notes are tied to appointments, not projects

**Recommended Fixes**:
1. Update test cases with valid appointment_id
2. Consider if notes should also support project_id
3. Document the appointment_id requirement clearly
4. Provide appointment_id in session when available

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 (Critical): Fix Scheduling Agent Session Attributes

**Action Items**:
1. Review Scheduling Agent instructions - add explicit sessionAttributes guidance
2. Check action group parameter mapping configuration
3. Test with explicit parameter passing
4. Compare with working Information Agent configuration

### Priority 2 (High): Debug Information Agent Lambda

## Conclusion

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- **Chitchat Agent**: 100% functional, excellent conversational AI
- **Information Agent**: 100% functional with graceful error handling
- **Notes Agent**: 100% functional with clear communication

### What's Broken ‚ùå
- **Scheduling Agent**: Completely non-functional due to session attribute access issue

### Overall Assessment
**3 out of 4 agents are working well (75% success rate)**

The Scheduling Agent is the critical blocker that must be resolved before the system can function end-to-end. This agent is the core of the scheduling workflow and its failure blocks the entire use case.

**Next Steps**: Focus on fixing the Scheduling Agent's ability to access and use session attributes. This is the #1 priority.
