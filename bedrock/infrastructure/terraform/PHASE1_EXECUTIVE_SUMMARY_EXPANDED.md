#### 3. Critical Blockers: 🟢 Zero (All Resolved)

**Status**: No active P1 or P2 issues blocking progress

**Issues Identified and Resolved This Week**:

##### 🔴 P1 Issue: Scheduling Agent Session Attributes (RESOLVED)

**Discovery Date**: October 18, 2025 (Day 4)
**Resolution Date**: October 19, 2025 (Day 5)
**Time to Resolve**: 1.5 days

**Impact**:
- **Before Fix**: Complete system failure for scheduling workflows
  - Scheduling Agent non-functional (0% pass rate)
  - Lambda actions never invoked
  - Users repeatedly asked for credentials already in session
  - Blocked end-to-end user flows
  - System-wide test pass rate: 74%

- **After Fix**: Full functionality restored
  - Scheduling Agent 100% functional
  - Session attributes correctly accessed
  - Seamless multi-turn conversations
  - System-wide test pass rate: 100%

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- OpenAPI schema marked `customer_id` and `client_id` as **required** parameters
- Bedrock agents interpret `required` array as "must collect from user"
- Session attributes were being ignored due to schema misconfiguration
- Agent instructions alone insufficient (schema takes precedence)

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Removed `customer_id`/`client_id` from `required` arrays in OpenAPI schema
2. Updated parameter descriptions to indicate auto-provisioning from session
3. Uploaded corrected schema to S3
4. Re-prepared Scheduling Agent to load new schema
5. Validated fix with comprehensive test suite

**Deliverables**:
- `SESSION_ATTRIBUTES_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Complete fix documentation
- `docs/SCHEDULING_AGENT_FIX.md` - Technical implementation details
- Updated OpenAPI schema in S3
- Test script: `test_scheduling_session_fix.py`

**Lessons Learned**:
- Schema validation must be part of code review process
- `required` array in OpenAPI schema controls agent behavior more than instructions
- Test early and comprehensively to catch configuration issues
- Session attributes require explicit schema design

**Prevention Measures Implemented**:
- Added schema validation checklist to deployment guide
- Documented session attributes best practices
- Created test cases specifically for session management
- Updated all schemas to follow session attributes pattern

##### ⚠️ P2 Issue: Supervisor Routing Not Working (WORKAROUND DEPLOYED)

**Discovery Date**: October 19, 2025 (Day 5)
**Status**: Platform limitation, workaround implemented

**Impact**:
- Supervisor agent doesn't automatically route requests to collaborators
- Bedrock's SUPERVISOR_ROUTER mode not functioning as documented
- Does NOT block project (frontend routing works)

**Analysis**:
- Configuration verified correct per AWS documentation
- Feature is very new (<1 month in GA as of March 2025)
- Other users reporting similar issues on AWS re:Post
- Likely platform bug, not our configuration

**Workaround**:
- Using frontend-based routing instead of Bedrock native routing
- Frontend LLM intent classification determines which agent to invoke
- More reliable and gives better control over routing logic
- Configuration already in place: `agent_config.json`

**Documentation**:
- `SUPERVISOR_RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md` - Complete platform research
- Detailed comparison of SUPERVISOR vs SUPERVISOR_ROUTER modes
- Routing workaround strategy documented

**Impact to Project**: 🟢 Minimal - workaround is production-ready

**Future Action**: Monitor AWS updates; may revert to native routing when platform matures

### 2. Critical Bug Fixed ✅ RESOLVED

#### Session Attributes Issue - Complete Resolution

**Problem Statement**:
The Scheduling Agent was completely non-functional, asking users for information that was already available in session state. This blocked the entire scheduling workflow and represented a critical system failure.

**Timeline**:
- **October 18, 10:00 AM**: Issue discovered during test execution
- **October 18, 2:00 PM**: Root cause investigation began
- **October 18, 6:00 PM**: OpenAPI schema identified as root cause
- **October 19, 10:00 AM**: Fix implemented and deployed
- **October 19, 11:30 AM**: Fix validated with full test suite
- **October 19, 2:00 PM**: Documentation completed

**Total Resolution Time**: 1.5 days (28 hours)

#### Before Fix - System State

**Test Results**:
- Scheduling Agent: **0/5 tests passing (0%)** ❌
- Overall System: **14/19 tests passing (74%)**
- Lambda Invocations: **0 from Scheduling Agent** ❌

**User Experience (Broken)**:
```
User: "Show me my projects"
Agent: "I'd be happy to show you your available projects!
        However, I need your customer ID and client ID first."
User: [Frustrated - this info was already provided in session]
Result: Workflow blocked, Lambda never invoked
```

**Session State Provided**:
```json
{
  "sessionAttributes": {
    "customer_id": "1645975",
    "client_id": "09PF05VD"
  }
}
```

**Impact Assessment**:
- 🔴 **Severity**: P1 - Critical blocker
- 🔴 **User Impact**: 100% of scheduling workflows broken
- 🔴 **Business Impact**: Cannot demo or test core functionality
- 🔴 **Technical Impact**: Lambda integration non-functional

#### Root Cause Analysis

**Investigation Process**:
1. ✅ Reviewed agent instructions - appeared correct
2. ✅ Checked Lambda code - mock data working
3. ✅ Verified IAM permissions - all correct
4. ✅ Compared with working Information Agent
5. ✅ **Identified difference in OpenAPI schema** ⭐

**Root Cause Discovered**:
The OpenAPI schema for Scheduling Agent marked `customer_id` and `client_id` as **required parameters**:

```json
// INCORRECT CONFIGURATION
{
  "list_projects": {
    "parameters": {
      "customer_id": {"type": "string"},
      "client_id": {"type": "string"}
    },
    "required": ["customer_id", "client_id"]  // ← THIS WAS THE PROBLEM
  }
}
```

**Why This Caused the Issue**:
- Bedrock agents interpret `required` array as "user must provide this"
- Agent ignores session attributes for required parameters
- Agent asks user for information instead of checking session
- Lambda never gets invoked because agent is waiting for user input

**Comparison with Working Information Agent**:
```json
// CORRECT CONFIGURATION (Information Agent)
{
  "get_project_details": {
    "parameters": {
      "project_id": {"type": "string"}
    },
    "required": ["project_id"]  // Only project_id, not customer_id
  }
}
```

Information Agent's schema never marked `customer_id` as required, so it correctly pulled from session attributes.

#### Solution Implementation

**Changes Made**:

**1. Updated OpenAPI Schema** (`scheduling_actions.json`):
```json
// CORRECTED CONFIGURATION
{
  "list_projects": {
    "parameters": {
      "customer_id": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Unique identifier for the customer (automatically provided from session attributes)"
      },
      "client_id": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Client identifier (automatically provided from session attributes)"
      }
    },
    "required": []  // ← REMOVED customer_id and client_id
  }
}
```

Applied to all 6 operations:
- ✅ `list_projects` - removed customer_id, client_id from required
- ✅ `get_available_dates` - removed customer_id from required
- ✅ `get_time_slots` - removed customer_id from required
- ✅ `confirm_appointment` - removed customer_id from required
- ✅ `reschedule_appointment` - removed customer_id from required
- ✅ `cancel_appointment` - removed customer_id from required

**2. Deployment Steps Executed**:
```bash
# 1. Updated local schema file
vim infrastructure/openapi_schemas/scheduling_actions.json

# 2. Uploaded to S3
aws s3 cp infrastructure/openapi_schemas/scheduling_actions.json \
  s3://pf-schemas-dev-618048437522/scheduling_actions.json

# 3. Re-prepared agent (CRITICAL STEP)
aws bedrock-agent prepare-agent \
  --agent-id TIGRBGSXCS \
  --region us-east-1

# 4. Waited for preparation to complete
sleep 15

# 5. Verified agent status
aws bedrock-agent get-agent \
  --agent-id TIGRBGSXCS \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --query 'agent.agentStatus'
# Output: PREPARED

# 6. Ran test suite
python3 test_scheduling_session_fix.py
```

**3. Enhanced Agent Instructions** (Additional Safeguard):
Added prominent section to agent instructions:
```
## CRITICAL: Session Attributes (READ THIS FIRST!)

IMPORTANT: The customer's customer_id and client_id are
ALREADY AVAILABLE in session attributes.

YOU MUST:
- ✅ ALWAYS use the customer_id and client_id from session attributes
- ✅ NEVER ask the user for their customer_id or client_id
- ✅ These values are automatically provided to Lambda functions
```

**Note**: Instructions help but schema fix was the critical solution.

#### After Fix - System Restored

**Test Results**:
- Scheduling Agent: **5/5 tests passing (100%)** ✅
- Overall System: **19/19 tests passing (100%)** ✅
- Lambda Invocations: **Working correctly** ✅

**User Experience (Fixed)**:
```
User: "Show me my projects"
