# Supervisor Agent Setup Report

**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Agent ID**: WF1S95L7X1
**Alias**: TSTALIASID
**Status**: Configured but routing needs investigation

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. AWS CLI Update
- **Previous Version**: 2.31.13
- **Updated Version**: 2.31.18
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

### 2. Collaborator Association
Successfully associated 4 specialist agents as collaborators to the supervisor:

| Collaborator | Agent ID | Alias ID | Collaborator ID | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scheduling-Agent | TIGRBGSXCS | PNDF9AQVHW | LCPYAE9TDO | ‚úÖ Associated |
| Information-Agent | JEK4SDJOOU | LF61ZU9X2T | T55HLLFLGJ | ‚úÖ Associated |
| Notes-Agent | CF0IPHCFFY | YOBOR0JJM7 | XDFZVYKNOR | ‚úÖ Associated |
| Chitchat-Agent | GXVZEOBQ64 | RSSE65OYGM | TNHOEYEOMN | ‚úÖ Associated |

**Key Configuration**:
- All collaborators use `v1` aliases (PNDF9AQVHW, LF61ZU9X2T, YOBOR0JJM7, RSSE65OYGM)
- TSTALIASID test alias cannot be used for collaborator associations
- `relayConversationHistory` set to `TO_COLLABORATOR` for all collaborators

### 3. Collaboration Instructions
Each collaborator has detailed instructions:

**Scheduling-Agent**:
```
This agent handles all appointment scheduling tasks including: listing available dates and
time slots for projects, confirming and scheduling new appointments, rescheduling existing
appointments, and canceling appointments. Route all scheduling-related requests to this agent.
```

**Information-Agent**:
```
This agent provides information about projects, orders, and their status. It can retrieve
project details, order information, installation addresses, project types, and current status.
Route all information and status inquiry requests to this agent.
```

**Notes-Agent**:
```
This agent manages notes and communication related to projects. It can create, retrieve,
update, and delete notes associated with projects and customers. Route all note-taking and
note-retrieval requests to this agent.
```

**Chitchat-Agent**:
```
This agent handles casual conversation, greetings, general inquiries, and small talk. It
provides friendly, conversational responses to non-task-specific questions. Route all general
conversation and greeting requests to this agent.
```

### 4. Supervisor Agent Prepared
- Supervisor prepared with all 4 collaborators: ‚úÖ
- Agent status: `PREPARED`
- TSTALIASID alias status: `PREPARED`
- TSTALIASID routing: Points to `DRAFT` version ‚úÖ

## üß™ Testing Results

### Test 1: Greeting (Chitchat Agent)
**Input**: "Hello! How are you today?"

**Expected**: Route to Chitchat-Agent
**Result**: ‚úÖ **PASSED**

```
Response: "Hello! I'm doing great, thanks for asking! I'm here to help you schedule
appointments with our property management team. What can I do for you today?"
```

### Test 2: Scheduling Request
**Input**: "Show me my projects"
**Session Attributes**:
```json
{
  "customer_id": "1645975",
  "client_id": "09PF05VD"
}
```

**Expected**: Route to Scheduling-Agent ‚Üí Invoke Lambda ‚Üí Return project list
**Result**: ‚ùå **FAILED** - Supervisor handling request itself

```
Response: "I'm unable to display a full list of all your projects at this moment. However,
I can provide you with detailed information about any specific project if you have the project
ID or name."
```

### Test 3: Explicit Scheduling Request
**Input**: "I want to schedule an appointment"
**Session Attributes**: Same as above

**Expected**: Route to Scheduling-Agent
**Result**: ‚ùå **FAILED** - Supervisor handling request itself

```
Response: "I'd be happy to help you schedule an appointment! To get started, could you please
provide your customer ID?"
```

**Note**: Customer ID was already provided in session attributes but not being used.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Current Configuration

### Supervisor Agent Configuration
```json
{
  "agentId": "WF1S95L7X1",
  "agentName": "pf-supervisor",
  "agentCollaboration": "SUPERVISOR",
  "orchestrationType": "DEFAULT",
  "agentStatus": "PREPARED",
  "foundationModel": "us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0"
}
```

### Supervisor Instructions
The supervisor has detailed routing instructions that explicitly state:
- "Don't try to answer questions yourself - route to the appropriate specialist"
- "What projects are available?" ‚Üí **Scheduling Agent**
- "I want to schedule an appointment" ‚Üí **Scheduling Agent**

**Despite clear instructions, the supervisor is NOT routing to collaborators.**

### Conversation Relay Configuration
All collaborators configured with:
```json
{
  "relayConversationHistory": "TO_COLLABORATOR"
}
```

This allows the supervisor to share full conversation context with collaborators.

## üîç Issue Analysis

### Issue: Supervisor Not Routing to Collaborators

**Symptoms**:
1. Supervisor responds directly to scheduling requests
2. Does not delegate to Scheduling-Agent collaborator
3. Does not invoke collaborator's Lambda functions
4. Asks for information already available in session attributes

**What We Checked**:
- ‚úÖ Collaborators properly associated
- ‚úÖ Collaboration instructions are clear
- ‚úÖ relayConversationHistory enabled
- ‚úÖ Supervisor instructions explicitly say to delegate
- ‚úÖ TSTALIASID alias points to DRAFT version
- ‚úÖ Agent status is PREPARED
- ‚úÖ Using v1 aliases (not TSTALIASID) for collaborators

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Orchestration Type**: The `orchestrationType: DEFAULT` might not support automatic routing
   - May need special orchestration type for supervisor-collaborator delegation
   - AWS documentation may specify required orchestration configuration

2. **Bedrock Supervisor Limitations**:
   - Supervisor-collaborator feature might work differently than expected
   - May require additional invocation parameters or configuration
   - Might need explicit API calls rather than automatic routing

3. **Model Behavior**:
   - Claude Sonnet 4.5 might not trigger collaborator invocations
   - Instructions alone may not be sufficient to trigger routing
   - May need special prompting format or keywords

4. **Session Attribute Passing**:
   - Session attributes might not be passed to supervisor properly
   - Collaborators might not receive session state from supervisor

## üìä Verification Commands

### List All Collaborators
```bash
aws bedrock-agent list-agent-collaborators \
  --agent-id "WF1S95L7X1" \
  --agent-version "DRAFT" \
  --region us-east-1
```

### Check Specific Collaborator Configuration
```bash
aws bedrock-agent get-agent-collaborator \
  --agent-id "WF1S95L7X1" \
  --agent-version "DRAFT" \
  --collaborator-id "LCPYAE9TDO" \
  --region us-east-1
```

### Get Supervisor Agent Details
```bash
aws bedrock-agent get-agent \
  --agent-id "WF1S95L7X1" \
  --region us-east-1
```

### Test Supervisor Agent
```bash
python3 test_supervisor.py
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Research AWS Documentation
- Search for "Bedrock agent supervisor collaborator routing"
- Check if special orchestration type is required
- Review AWS examples of supervisor-collaborator patterns
- Look for API parameters that enable routing

### 2. Check Specialist Agent Direct Invocation
Before investigating supervisor further, verify specialist agents work directly:
```bash
# Test Scheduling Agent directly (not through supervisor)
python3 test_direct_scheduling.py
```

**Current Result**: Scheduling agent asks for customer_id even when provided in sessionState.
**Issue to investigate**: Why aren't session attributes being passed to specialist agents?

### 3. Alternative Approaches

If automatic routing doesn't work, consider:

**Option A: Frontend Routing**
- Frontend analyzes user intent
- Directly invokes appropriate specialist agent
- Don't use supervisor for routing
- Update `agent_config.json` routing method

**Option B: Custom Supervisor Lambda**
- Create Lambda function that analyzes intent
- Programmatically invokes appropriate agent
- Returns agent response to user
- More control over routing logic

**Option C: Supervisor with Action Groups**
- Add action groups to supervisor
- Action groups invoke collaborator agents
- Might trigger routing mechanism
- Requires creating OpenAPI schemas for routing actions

### 4. AWS Support Inquiry
If the issue persists, consider opening AWS Support case:
- **Question**: "How to configure Bedrock supervisor agent to automatically route requests to associated collaborators?"
- **Include**: Agent IDs, configuration details, test results
- **Ask about**: Required orchestration type, invocation parameters, examples

---

## üìÅ Helper Scripts Created

### 1. `test_supervisor.py`
Tests supervisor routing with two scenarios:
- Greeting (should route to Chitchat)
- Scheduling request (should route to Scheduling)

### 2. `test_direct_scheduling.py`
Tests Scheduling agent directly, bypassing supervisor.

### 3. `test_explicit_routing.py`
Tests supervisor with exact phrasing from routing examples.

### 4. `prepare_agents.sh` (already exists)
Script to prepare agents, create aliases, and configure action groups.

## üìù Summary

**What's Working**:
- ‚úÖ All 4 collaborators successfully associated
- ‚úÖ Conversation relay enabled
- ‚úÖ Supervisor agent prepared and ready
- ‚úÖ TSTALIASID alias properly configured
- ‚úÖ Supervisor responds to queries (just not delegating)

**What's NOT Working**:
- ‚ùå Supervisor not routing to collaborators
- ‚ùå Supervisor handling requests itself instead of delegating
- ‚ùå Session attributes not being utilized by supervisor
- ‚ùå No collaborator Lambda invocations occurring

**Recommendation**:
1. Research AWS Bedrock supervisor routing documentation
2. Verify specialist agents work with session attributes when invoked directly
3. Consider alternative routing approaches (frontend, custom Lambda)
4. Potentially open AWS Support case for guidance

The infrastructure is correctly set up, but the supervisor routing mechanism needs further investigation to work as intended.
