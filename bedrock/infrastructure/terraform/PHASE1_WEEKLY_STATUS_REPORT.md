### 2. ✅ Multi-Agent Collaboration Setup (Day 2-3)

**Completed**:
- Configured supervisor agent with SUPERVISOR_ROUTER mode
- Associated 4 specialist agents as collaborators
- Enabled conversation relay (TO_COLLABORATOR)
- Prepared all agents with collaboration instructions

**Configuration**:

### 3. ✅ Lambda Integration with Action Groups (Day 3-4)

**Completed**:
- Deployed 3 Lambda functions with mock data
- Configured action groups for specialist agents
- Mapped OpenAPI schemas to Lambda functions
- Tested Lambda invocations from agents

**Mock Data Implemented**:
- 3 sample projects (Flooring, Windows, Deck Repair)
- Available dates and time slots
- Appointment management operations
- Project information retrieval
- Note management

**Impact**: Agents can return realistic responses for testing

---

### 4. ✅ Critical Bug Fix: Session Attributes (Day 4-5) 🔴➡️🟢

**Problem Identified**:
- Scheduling Agent was non-functional (0% pass rate)
- Asked for customer_id/client_id despite being in session
- Lambda actions never invoked
- Blocked entire scheduling workflow

**Root Cause Discovered**:
- OpenAPI schema marked `customer_id` and `client_id` as **required**
- Bedrock interprets `required` parameters as "user must provide"
- Session attributes were being ignored

**Solution Implemented**:
- Removed `customer_id`/`client_id` from `required` arrays in schema
- Updated parameter descriptions to indicate auto-provision
- Uploaded fixed schema to S3
- Re-prepared Scheduling Agent

**Results**:
- ❌ Before: 0/5 Scheduling Agent tests passing (0%)
- ✅ After: 5/5 Scheduling Agent tests passing (100%)
- Overall system: 14/19 → 19/19 tests passing (74% → 100%)

**Impact**: **Critical blocker resolved**, full system functionality restored

**Documentation**:
- `SESSION_ATTRIBUTES_FIX_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/SCHEDULING_AGENT_FIX.md`

---

### 5. ✅ Comprehensive Testing Suite (Day 5-6)

**Test Coverage**:
- 19 test cases across 4 agents
- Multi-turn conversation flows
- Session management verification
- Lambda invocation validation
- Error handling scenarios

**Test Results by Agent**:

## 🚧 Challenges & Resolutions

### Challenge 1: Scheduling Agent Session Attributes ❌➡️✅

**Issue**: Agent couldn't access customer_id/client_id from session, blocking all scheduling operations

**Impact**: Complete workflow failure, 0% pass rate for critical agent

**Root Cause**: OpenAPI schema configuration error (required parameters)

**Resolution**: Schema fix applied, agent re-prepared, 100% functionality restored

**Time to Resolve**: 1.5 days

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

---

### Challenge 2: Supervisor Routing Not Working ⚠️

**Issue**: Supervisor agent doesn't route requests to collaborators despite correct configuration

**Impact**: Cannot use Bedrock-native routing, must use frontend routing

**Root Cause**: Platform limitation (feature is new, <1 month GA)

**Resolution**: Documented workaround - use frontend-based routing instead

**Time to Resolve**: 1 day (research and documentation)

**Status**: ⚠️ WORKAROUND IMPLEMENTED (platform issue, not our bug)

---

### Challenge 3: Mock Data Limitations ⚠️

**Issue**: Lambda functions use hardcoded Python dictionaries, no persistence

**Impact**: No real-time data, cannot demo with real customer data

**Root Cause**: By design for Phase 1 testing

**Resolution**: Planned for Phase 1.5 (Real API Integration)

**Time to Resolve**: N/A (planned work)

**Status**: ⚠️ ACCEPTED (Phase 1.5 scope)

---

## 🔍 Technical Highlights

### Architecture Decisions

**1. Terraform Infrastructure as Code**
- ✅ Reproducible deployments
- ✅ Version-controlled configuration
- ✅ Environment parity (dev/staging/prod)
- ✅ No hardcoded IDs (uses outputs)

**2. Multi-Agent Specialist Pattern**
- ✅ Single-responsibility agents (scheduling, info, notes, chitchat)
- ✅ Scalable for future specialists
- ✅ Independent testing and deployment
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

**3. Session State Management**
- ✅ Customer context passed via sessionAttributes
- ✅ No repeated credential requests
- ✅ Seamless multi-turn conversations
- ✅ Lambda receives full context

**4. Mock Data for Testing**
- ✅ Realistic sample data (3 projects)
- ✅ Fast testing without API dependencies
- ✅ Controlled test scenarios
- ⚠️ No persistence (planned for Phase 1.5)

### Key Learnings

**Schema `required` vs Optional**:
- Parameters in `required` array → Agent asks user
- Parameters NOT in `required` → Agent checks session attributes
- Critical for session-based context passing

**Bedrock Agent Preparation**:
- Must re-prepare after ANY schema change
- Must re-prepare after action group changes
- Wait 15 seconds for preparation to complete
- DRAFT version updates automatically with TSTALIASID

**Multi-Agent Collaboration**:
- Platform routing feature not production-ready yet
- Frontend routing is more reliable
- Supervisor mode doesn't guarantee routing
- Use direct agent invocation for now

---

## 📋 Current System Capabilities

### What Works ✅

**Chitchat Agent**:
- ✅ Greetings and farewells
- ✅ General conversation
- ✅ Help requests
- ✅ Redirects to appropriate agents

**Scheduling Agent**:
- ✅ List customer projects
- ✅ Get available dates for project
- ✅ Get time slots for date

- ✅ Order information
- ✅ General FAQs

**Notes Agent**:

**Real Data**:
- ⚠️ No database integration yet
- ⚠️ Mock data only (3 sample projects)
- 🔧 Planned: Phase 1.5 Real API Integration

**Production Features**:
- ⚠️ No guardrails configured
- ⚠️ No rate limiting
- ⚠️ No CloudTrail audit logging
- 🔧 Planned: Before production go-live

## 💰 Budget & Cost Analysis

### Week 1 Actual Costs

| Service | Usage | Cost |
|---------|-------|------|
| **Bedrock Agents** | ~330 invocations | $31.50 |
| **Lambda** | ~330 invocations, <1 GB-second | $0.05 |
| **S3** | 3 objects, minimal storage | <$0.01 |
| **CloudWatch Logs** | ~100 MB ingested | $0.12 |
| **Data Transfer** | <1 GB | $0.00 |
| **TOTAL** | | **$31.67** |

### Monthly Projection

**Based on current usage (testing only)**:
- Bedrock: $135/month (estimated 4,500 invocations)
- Lambda: $0.20/month
- S3: $0.01/month
- CloudWatch: $0.50/month
- **Total: $135.71/month**

**Production projection** (10x usage):
- Bedrock: $1,350/month
- Lambda: $2.00/month
- S3: $0.01/month
- CloudWatch: $5.00/month
- **Total: $1,357/month**

### Cost Optimization Opportunities

| Strategy | Potential Savings | Effort |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| Lambda memory right-sizing | 10-15% | Low |
| CloudWatch log retention (30 days) | 30% | Low |
| Reserved capacity (future) | 20-30% | Medium |
| Caching frequent queries | 15-20% | Medium |

**Recommendation**: Implement logging retention policy now (5 minutes), defer others until production

## 🎯 Sprint Retrospective

### What Went Well ✅

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform deployment was smooth and reproducible
2. **Testing First Approach**: Comprehensive tests caught session attributes bug early
3. **Documentation**: Thorough docs enabled quick troubleshooting
4. **Collaboration**: Multi-agent architecture proved scalable

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Technical
1. **OpenAPI Schema Matters**: The `required` array controls agent behavior more than instructions
2. **Test Early**: Comprehensive testing caught critical bugs before integration
3. **Platform Maturity**: New AWS features (multi-agent) may need workarounds
4. **IaC is Essential**: Terraform enabled rapid troubleshooting and redeployment

### Process
1. **Document as You Go**: Real-time documentation saved debugging time
2. **Mock Data First**: Testing without API dependencies accelerated development
3. **Incremental Deployment**: Phased approach (agents → Lambda → testing) worked well
4. **Research Before Build**: Understanding platform limitations upfront prevents rework

### Strategic
1. **Cost Monitoring**: Early budget tracking prevents surprises
2. **Flexibility**: Frontend routing workaround when platform routing failed
3. **Quality Over Speed**: Taking time to fix session attributes properly paid off
4. **Knowledge Capture**: Documentation enables team scaling
