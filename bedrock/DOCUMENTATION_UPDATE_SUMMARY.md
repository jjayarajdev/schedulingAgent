## Documentation Status

| Document Type | Status | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| **Entry Point Docs** | ✅ Complete | START_HERE.md, README.md updated |
| **Integration Guides** | ✅ Complete | PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md updated |
| **Architecture Docs** | ✅ Complete | Terraform README.md updated |
| **v2.0 Technical Docs** | ✅ Complete | Already created, no updates needed |
| **API Documentation** | ⏩ Not Updated | API structure unchanged in v2.0 |
| **Lambda Docs** | ⏩ Not Updated | Lambda functions unchanged in v2.0 |
| **Phase 2/3 Planning** | ⏩ Not Updated | Future work, not affected by v2.0 |

---

## What Was NOT Updated (And Why)

### Lambda Function Documentation
- **Reason:** Lambda functions remain the same in v2.0
- **Files:** `lambda/*/README.md`
- **Impact:** None - routing change doesn't affect Lambda layer

### API Documentation
- **Reason:** API endpoints unchanged, only routing method changed
- **Files:** `docs/api-documentation.html`, OpenAPI schemas
- **Impact:** None - same APIs, different routing

### Phase 2/3 Planning Docs
- **Reason:** Future work not affected by v2.0 routing changes
- **Files:** `docs/phase2/*`, `docs/phase3/*`
- **Impact:** None - SMS/Voice integration independent of routing

### Historical/Archive Docs
- **Reason:** Archive docs kept for reference, not updated
- **Files:** `docs/archive/*`
- **Impact:** None - historical reference only

### Test Scripts (Terraform)
- **Reason:** Test scripts still valid, test both approaches
- **Files:** `infrastructure/terraform/test_*.py`
- **Impact:** Low - tests still work, show comparison

---

## Consistency Check

All updated files now consistently show:

✅ **Version:** 2.0 or "2.0 - Frontend Routing"
✅ **Status:** Production Ready
✅ **Accuracy:** 100%
✅ **Routing Method:** Frontend Classification (Claude Haiku)
✅ **Agent IDs:** Production values (TIGRBGSXCS, JEK4SDJOOU, etc.)
✅ **Performance:** 36% faster, 44% cheaper
✅ **References:** Link to ROUTING_COMPARISON.md and IMPROVEMENTS_V2.md
✅ **Supervisor:** Marked as deprecated with explanation

---
