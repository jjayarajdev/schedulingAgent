AI Scheduling Agent — Vision & High-Level Plan

Problem (short)

Service businesses burn cash and margin on phone jockeys and coordinators. They answer phones, confirm, reschedule, follow up, handle status requests, nonstop. It’s expensive, error-prone, and slow. That friction kills revenue, creates no-shows, and drags down customer experience.

Bold Goal

Build an AI Scheduling & Interaction Agent that handle ≥80% of customer and coordinator scheduling tasks,  reliably, 24/7, so customers get fast, accurate service and our teams focus on high-value work. No attitude. No excuses. Just fewer manual touches, more bookings, fewer no-shows, and measurable ROI.

Vision (what success looks like)

Consumers self-serve or have natural phone conversations to book, confirm, reschedule, cancel, add notes, and get status with live, accurate data.
Coordinators use the same agent internally to route-optimize, bulk-schedule, validate orders, suggest fixes, and run admin commands (e.g., “optimize projects 123-132 for tomorrow; show arrival windows”).
Agent works across chat (portal), SMS, and voice with identical capabilities and full auditability in ProjectsForce 360.
Built with guardrails: function-only writes for any system-changing action, hallucination detection, PII masking, and legal/TCPA compliance.
Core Capabilities (concrete)

Customer-facing

Book / reschedule / cancel appointments.
Confirm appointment details and tech info.
Provide real-time order status and ETA.
Add order notes, photos, or prep instructions.
Weather-aware scheduling suggestions for weather-sensitive categories (roofing, exterior installs): warns of risk and gently offers alternatives.
Internal / Coordinator-facing

Natural language admin commands (chat/Slack/console): “Route-optimize these 10 projects for tomorrow” → returns prioritized schedule + arrival windows.
Bulk ops: batch assign, unassign, bulk reschedule with human override.
Intelligent order validation: flags likely problems (missing permit, conflicting dates, missing measurements).
Context cards: summarized job + recent communication + risk flags.
Channel Parity

Identical capabilities via chat, SMS, and inbound/outbound voice.
Voice: STT → NLU → orchestrator → TTS; confirmations recorded + transcript stored.
Guardrails & Safety

Function-only writes for bookings/reschedules (LLM suggests, system executes only after schema-validated call).
Golden-dataset checks and hallucination detection for factual queries.
Confirmation step for critical writes (e.g., “I’ll schedule that for May 5 at 9 AM, confirm?”).
Full audit log: action, timestamp, actor (AI or human), transcript.
TCPA/legal consent capture before outbound calls; PII masked in logs.
Example Customer Flow (happy path)

Job marked RTS in PF360 → system triggers outbound SMS/phone invite.
Customer replies “Yes” or picks a slot via link. OR Agent calls: “Hi, we can do Tue 9–11 or Wed 1–3. Which works?”
Agent confirms, writes via function call, sends calendar invite + prep checklist, logs transcript.
24-hour reminder: Agent calls/texts, asks readiness question, offers reschedule if needed.
If anything, unexpected appears, agent routes to human with full context.
Example Coordinator Flow (happy path)

Coordinator pastes 10 project numbers into chat: “Optimize for tomorrow.”
Agent returns optimized route, suggested arrival windows, and highlights conflicts.
Coordinator asks: “Assign these to Team A and confirm.” Agent performs assign after confirmation and logs action.
Non-Functional Requirements

High accuracy for intent detection and slot filling (target: >95% on happy-path tests).
Low latency for chat responses (<1s target) and acceptable voice round-trip (<2–3s average STT/TTS).
Scalable to X calls/messages/hour (we’ll determine capacity after usage costing).
Secure: encryption in transit and at rest; access controls for logs/transcripts.
KPIs (measure from Day 1)

% of scheduling tasks fully automated (target ≥80%).
Avg time-to-book (baseline vs post-launch).
No-show rate change.
Support ticket deflection (%) tied to scheduling/support queries.
% of escalations to humans and root causes.
Customer satisfaction post-interaction (CSAT).
Accuracy of function-call writes (errors per 1,000 writes).
Pilot Plan (practical)

Scope: Book/confirm/reschedule + status queries via SMS and chat. Voice inbound/outbound as optional second wave.
Pilot customers: 5–10 friendly accounts; limited categories (interior installs, flooring) then expand to weather-affected categories.
Window: 2-week pilot, monitored in real-time with override capability.
Success gate: 70%+ fully automated bookings with <2% critical write errors.
Risks & Mitigations — be explicit

Hallucinations → enforce function-only writes; golden dataset + response validation.
STT failures/noisy lines → SMS fallback + human override for uncertain utterances.
API instability → develop against stubs; require API contract freeze before pilot; idempotent writes.
TCPA/consent → legal signoff + consent capture before outbound; opt-out handling built-in.
Customer trust → always show “You’re speaking with ProjectsForce Agent, human escalation available” and provide easy human-in-loop path.
